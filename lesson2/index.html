            Melissa Clark’s Dinner In One Will Be Your Go-To Fall Cookbook

        <p>
            The concept behind Melissa Clark’s new cookbook, Dinner in One, is exactly as advertised: every recipe—from
            miso glazed salmon with sugar snap peas, to butternut squash cavatelli, to a ricotta olive oil pound
            cake—can be done in a singular pot, pan, or bowl.
        </p>
        <p>
            The beloved New York Times food writer began writing it during the early days of the pandemic. Clark, like
            the rest of us, was making every single meal from the confines of her home kitchen—resulting in a sink
            pile-up that never seemed to die down, like a twisted Groundhog Day of dishes. “That’s when it really hits
            you—how many dishes you use in a day, especially when you are cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner for your
            home family,” she tells Vogue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like the rest of us, Clark hates dishes. But unlike the rest of us, she had the skillset to do something
            about it: the cookbook author had long been translating recipes by professional chefs into streamlined
            versions for the home cook. So over the following year, she developed—and collected—an extensive group of
            recipes that are elevated yet easy to clean up for us all. The result? A comprehensive cookbook full of
            weeknight staples, entertaining crowd-pleasers, and delicious desserts. It'll serve you, your family, your
            friends, and most of all, your sanity, for years to come.
        </p>

            Below, a Q&A with Clark—as well as a recipe for her creamy goat cheese pasta—ahead of Dinner in One’s
            publication on September 6.

        <p>
            <mark>Vogue:</mark> This cookbook really speaks to me because I hate dishes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <mark>Melissa Clark:</mark> Don’t we all! I hope this helps you out.
        </p>
        <p>
            <mark>You wrote that the origin story for this cookbook was your time shadowing chefs in professional
            kitchens. You saw them use all these different pots and plans—and then realized that they have professional
            dishwashers helping them. This, in turn, has inspired a lifetime of streamlining for you.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was always shocked at the way that chefs expected home cooks to use as many pots and pans and dishes as
            they do when they wrote cookbooks—because this is the thing: they had staff and dishwashers, who were there
            cleaning up behind them. We home cooks did not. I was more tolerant of dishes before I had kids thirteen
            years ago. Then everything felt like it was so much more work. I thought “okay, something has to give—and
            it's got to be the dishes.” So I began to streamline. I said, “I’m going to reduce these dishes even more
            and get it down to as minimal preparation as possible.” Do I really need to get out another bowl? Or can I
            wipe out this bowl? Can't I use the same spoon to stir these two things?
        </p>
        <div class="question">
            <mark>When did you start working on this cookbook and what has that process been like?</mark>
        </div>
        <p>
            At the beginning of the pandemic. Remember early in the pandemic, when you were really cooking almost every
            single meal? That’s when it really hits you again—how many dishes you use in a day, especially when you're
            cooking breakfast, lunch, and dinner for your entire family. You’re like, “Oh my God, did I just wash that?
            Do I have to wash that again?” So that’s when I really started writing this particular book.
        </p>
        <div class="question">
            <mark>Half the recipes in this book don’t include meat. Why did you decide to lean into the more vegetarian
                and even vegan route?</mark>
        </div>
        <p>
            I am shifting my diet that way—I think a lot of people are. I’m doing it for climate reasons. I’m doing it
            for health reasons. I’m also doing it because I just like vegetables best of all.
        </p>
        <div class="question">
            <mark>I would say that all the recipes in this cookbook are fairly easy because they are one pot, one pan,
                one Dutch oven, and so on. But I'm going to give you a challenge of deciding: What is the
                easiest?</mark>
        </div>
        <p>
            They’re all easy—but the salmon salad is very easy and very fast. Also, the sheet pan chicken with oregano
            and potatoes. I think it’s probably the easiest roast chicken you'll ever make.
        </p>
        <div class="question">
            <mark>What recipe do you think will impress guests the most?</mark>
        </div>
        <p>
            There’s a sheet pan chicken tajine. You’re doing it on one sheet pan, but it's also so complex and
            delicious. It's got olives, and it's got dates, and it’s got all these different spices. It looks like a
            professional chef came to your house and made you dinner.
        </p>
        <div class="question">
            <mark>What’s your favorite recipe for fall in the book?</mark>
        </div>
        <p>
            I have a sheet pan Thanksgiving dinner, and it is so fun. There are turkey breasts. There are sweet
            potatoes. There are brussel sprouts—and it all cooks together. All you need to do is add some cranberry
            sauce and you can have Thanksgiving whenever you want Thanksgiving.
        </p>
        <div class="question">
            <mark>How about your favorite dessert?</mark>
        </div>
        <p>
            Oh gosh, I’m such a dessert person—I consider dessert to be an essential part of dinner, frankly. The
            chocolate coconut cake is my favorite, because chocolate and coconut is such a great combination. The cake
            is soft and the icing is fudgy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, a one-pot pasta recipe from Dinner in One.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Creamy Goat Cheese Pasta with Burst Cherry Tomatoes and Olives
        </h2>
        <p>
            Instead of starting the sauce in the skillet, then adding the dried pasta to cook in the sauce, here I cook
            the pasta first, drain it, then quickly mix together a creamy goat cheese sauce right in the pasta pot. It’s
            a lot like making one-pot mac and cheese, except with the more sophisticated flavors of goat cheese, olives,
            and garlicky tomatoes.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Kosher salt
            </li>
            <li>
                1 pound short pasta (such as orecchiette, farfalle, fusilli, or rigatoni)
            </li>
            <li>
                6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for serving
            </li>
            <li>
                5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>
                4 cups halved cherry tomatoes, divided
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup chopped pitted green olives (such as Castelvetrano)
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
            </li>
            <li>
                Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving
            </li>
            <li>
                6 ounces goat cheese, broken up into small pieces
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup heavy cream
            </li>
            <li>
                ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
            </li>
            <li>
                1 cup torn fresh basil leaves
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Directions
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until 1 minute shy of al dente
                (check the package directions for timing). Drain the pasta, reserving ½ cup pasta cooking water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the pot over medium-high heat and add 4 tablespoons of the oil. Add the garlic and cook until
                golden, about 2 minutes. Stir in about half the tomatoes, the olives, thyme, ½ teaspoon salt, black
                pepper, and red pepper flakes. Cook until the tomatoes just begin to soften, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce the heat to low and stir in the goat cheese and cream, letting it melt into a sauce. Remove from
                the heat and stir in the drained pasta, the remaining tomatoes, Parmesan, and remaining 2 tablespoons
                oil and toss until evenly coated. If the mixture looks dry, add a little pasta cooking water, a
                tablespoon at a time. Taste a piece of pasta to make sure it’s cooked through (if not, put the pot back
                on the heat for another minute or so, stirring). Stir in the basil.
            </li>
            <li>
                To serve, top the pasta with more Parmesan, red pepper flakes, and oil. SWAP IT OUT For a milder dish,
                try substituting fresh ricotta or a combination of cream cheese and cheddar, for the goat cheese, and
                adding some grated lemon zest at the end if you’d like to brighten it up.
            </li>
