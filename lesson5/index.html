                Most of us know <a href="#">Gustav Klimt</a> as the artist who painted <span>The Kiss</span>, that 1907
                masterpiece in which two figures melt into each other in a hungry embrace. He binds their bodies
                together in the same cloth: a shimmering gold tapestry whose pattern references both intimacy and
                anatomy. The side covering the man is decorated with erect rectangles, while the woman’s is swathed with
                concentric circles.
            </p>
            <p>Klimt, the leader of the <a href="#">Vienna Secession</a> movement, was a master of symbolism. He
                embedded
                allusions to sexuality and the human psyche in the rich, lavishly decorated figures and patterns that
                populated his canvases, murals, and mosaics. Often, their messages—of pleasure, sexual liberation, and
                human suffering—were only thinly veiled. His more risqué pieces, depicting voluptuous nudes and piles of
                entwined bodies, scandalized the Viennese establishment.</p>
            <p>
                Even so, the city’s elite adored his work and frequently commissioned him to paint their portraits. His
                artist peers were similarly enthralled with his style, recognizing Klimt’s groundbreaking injection of
                sexuality, atmosphere, and expression into figurative painting. When <a href="#">Auguste Rodin</a>
                visited
                Klimt’s famed <span>Beethoven Frieze</span> (1902), part of the Viennese Secession’s 14th exhibition, he
                lauded the piece as “so tragic and so divine.” A younger generation of European
                <a href="#">Expressionists</a>, including <a href="#">Egon Schiele</a>, lionized Klimt and latched onto
                him as
                their hero.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Klimt’s work still captivates us. Museums sell more color reproductions of Klimt’s paintings than
                those of any other artist. But there’s far more to the painter’s life and oeuvre than <span>The
                    Kiss.</span>

                <p>
                    Klimt didn’t like to talk about his personal life or work. “I am convinced that I am not
                    particularly interesting as a person. There is nothing special about me,” he once said. “I am a
                    painter who paints day after day from morning until night.” But the details he did leave behind tell
                    a different story. Klimt was an artist who passionately studied his craft and boldly rebelled
                    against the establishment; who was shy but enchanting; who wore caftans when he painted; and who
                    adored his pet cat, and—perhaps most of all—women. (Although Klimt never married, he fathered 14
                    children and was rumored to have numerous lovers.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was born in 1862 in Baumgarten, Austria, not far from Vienna. His father was a gold and silver
                    engraver; like several of his seven siblings, Klimt followed in his father’s footsteps. By age 14,
                    he had enrolled in Vienna’s School of Applied Arts where he studied a range of subjects, including
                    fresco painting and mosaic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was a devoted student and spent hours in Vienna’s museums poring over antique vases and other
                    treasures, and copying prize paintings like <a href="#">Titian’s</a> <span>Isabella d’Este</span>
                    (1534–36). He and his brother, Ernst, also showed early entrepreneurial instincts. They sold
                    portraits painted from photographs and made technical drawings for an ear specialist. These projects
                    contributed to Klimt’s early mastery of the human form.

                <p>
                    Simultaneously, Klimt began to take on decorative commissions, such as elaborate murals and ceiling
                    paintings for theaters and other public buildings. In the late 1880s, he populated them with
                    classical themes and mythological figures executed so deftly that they caught the eye of Emperor
                    Franz Josef, who awarded Klimt the Golden Order of Merit for his frescoes at the city’s Burgtheater.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, a steady stream of decorative and portrait commissions—and his resulting financial
                    independence and recognition—emboldened Klimt to take more creative risks. His erotic drawings of
                    women from the early 1900s reveal a career-long interest in the human form and desire (more
                    recently, these works have also <a href="#">been described</a> at misogynistic, a reading bolstered
                    by
                    Klimt’s reputation as <a href="#">a Casanova</a>). But on canvas, he had to be careful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some ways, Vienna was an intensely bohemian city during Klimt’s lifetime, filled with decadence
                    and artistic experimentation. But the city’s government and traditional art establishment railed
                    against this avant-garde cultural movement, which was propelled by young artists and intellectuals
                    including Klimt, architect Otto Wagner, composers Gustav Mahler and Arnold Schönberg, and
                    psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was in this paradoxical environment, which pitted Victorian repression against freedom of
                    expression, that Klimt came of age. Soon, he began to channel his reflections on desire, dreams, and
                    mortality through lush, symbol-laden paintings. “Whoever wants to know something about me,” Klimt
                    once said, “ought to look carefully at my pictures and try to see in them what I am and what I want
                    to do.”

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Early in his career, Klimt was enthralled with his predecessor <a href="#">Hans Makart’s</a>
                    elaborate
                    history paintings. Klimt found that he could safely explore his interest in the human form through
                    classical themes, like the trials and tribulations of Greek gods and mythological figures. In the
                    Burgtheater mural, for instance, his nimble, dancing nudes in <span>Theater in Taormina</span>
                    (1886–87) were palatable to an otherwise uptight society.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But after Klimt left school and entered his late twenties, he became increasingly influenced by the
                    Viennese avant-garde. The decadence and intellectual rebelliousness of his peers enthralled him. The
                    Jung-Wien group of writers reacted against moralistic 19th-century literature by exploring dreams
                    and sexuality in their work, while Freud “saw no upright object without interpreting it as erectile,
                    no orifice without potential penetration,” as historian Gilles Neret has pointed out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Klimt began to reject more traditional approaches to painting that favored classicism, rationality,
                    and naturalism. He started taking risks as early as 1890, when he was commissioned to paint a grand
                    mural depicting the history of art for the Kunsthistorisches Museum. He chose to represent each
                    stage, from Egypt to the Renaissance, through female figures. But unlike the historical and
                    allegorical paintings made by Klimt’s predecessors, he represented his subjects with human, rather
                    than godly, characteristics. In <span>Ancient Greece II (Girl from Tanagra)</span> (1890–91),
                    Klimt’s subject resembles one of his bohemian peers—a living, breathing woman with a brooding
                    air—rather than a serene, mythical being. She was the first of Klimt’s “femme fatales,” as Neret has
                    called the artist’s female subjects—strong, expressive women capable of both seduction and
                    destruction. This mural gave way to a period of mounting experimentation and rebelliousness in
                    Klimt’s work, as he teetered on the edge of acceptability.

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    By 1897, Klimt and some of his more adventurous artist and designer friends broke from the Vienna
                    Artists’ Association, a more traditional association of painters, to form a radical group called the
                    Secession (named after an ancient Roman term meaning “revolt against ruling powers”). Klimt became
                    the group’s president and its guiding spirit. A drawing he made for the first issue of the
                    movement’s magazine, <span>Ver Sacrum</span>, shows a naked woman holding a mirror up to the
                    audience—“as if to invite new inspiration, a new beginning,” writes historian Dr. Julia Kelly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Increasingly, Klimt’s inspiration became the psychological inquiry and preoccupation with sexuality
                    that pervaded the Viennese avant-garde. A favorite topic of the salons was the battles of the
                    sexes—in particular, the domination of woman over man. Klimt’s early interest in the female form
                    mingled with these themes, and he began to take more risks in his depictions of women. In works like
                    <span>Judith and the Head of Holofernes</span> (1901), he presents a strong, sexualized Judith
                    holding the head of her aggressor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Women had always been Klimt’s favorite subjects. “I am less interested in myself as a subject for
                    painting than I am in other people, above all women,” he once said. But by the early 1900s, his
                    depictions of women became increasingly expressive of their personalities and desires—and of human
                    emotion in general. Even his portraits of society women were rife with expressive features and gowns
                    that looked as if they’d been woven from flowers newly bursting into bloom. This exemplifies an
                    aspect of Klimt’s work in which “the anatomy of the models becomes ornamentation, and the
                    ornamentation becomes anatomy,” as art historian Alessandra Comini has said.

                <p>
                    The Viennese art establishment wasn’t pleased. While Klimt had won a commission for the University’s
                    ceremonial hall, critics immediately objected to the painter’s newly “indefinite forms and ambiguous
                    evocation of human relationships, suggestive of sexual liberation,” writes Kelly. In a sketch for
                    one panel of the mural, <span>Philosophy</span> (1899–1905), naked bodies entangle and rise into the
                    sky next to a whirl of stars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, Klimt quit the project, but he wasn’t deterred from continuing in this vein. “Enough of
                    censorship,” he said in response. “I want to get away.…I refuse every form of support from the
                    state, I’ll do without all of it.” From 1901–02, he painted <span>Goldfish</span>, originally titled
                    <span>To My Critics</span>. It shows a naked nymph sticking her rear in the direction of the viewer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not long after, Klimt took a trip to Ravenna, Italy, where he saw <span>Byzantine art</span>,
                    shimmering with gilded details. It stuck with him, and his famed Gold Period ensued. For portrait
                    commissions (when he was required to stay within the bounds of propriety), the clothing of his
                    subjects became tapestries of abstract shapes rendered in rich golds, reds, blues, and greens.
                    During this time, even paintings lacking human figures—like his landscapes or abstract friezes—were
                    filled with organic forms: undulating spirals, rushing whirlpools, profusions of flowers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Klimt edged closer to his untimely death at age 55 (the result of complications from a stroke),
                    references to the life cycle also appear more frequently in his paintings. <span>The Tree of
                        Life</span> (1905), for instance, becomes a recurring symbol in his late work. As Neret has
                    suggested, the tree brings together a number of the artist’s favorite themes: flowers, women, and
                    ever-changing seasons.

                    Klimt’s work boldly broke from artistic convention. He ushered in a new period of figuration that
                    jettisoned rigid tenets of naturalism and classicism. Instead, he favored expressive, virile, human
                    figures who made their desires and emotions known. These inclinations paved the way for the Vienna
                    Secession, of which Klimt was the fearless leader, and went on to influence Viennese Expressionism,
                    a movement <a href="#">spearheaded by his pupil, Schiele.</a> With Klimt as his inspiration, Schiele
                    further unmasked the emotional and psychological inner workings of his sitters.

                <p>
                    What’s more, Klimt’s mural work pioneered the union of art and architecture that would later
                    influence the <a href="#">Bauhaus</a> and the Russian <a href="#">Constructivists.</a> With
                    Secessionist
                    allies like architect Josef Hoffmann and designer Koloman Moser, Klimt expanded on the notion of the
                    <span>Gesamtkunstwerk</span>, or total artwork. He conceived both his <span>Beethoven Frieze</span>
                    and <span>Stoclet Frieze</span> (1905–11) so they would blend seamlessly with the architecture and
                    furniture that surrounded them.

                    Later in his career, Klimt continued to prove influential: The paintings from his Gold Period, as
                    well as structured landscapes he made just before his death, foreshadowed <a href="#">Art
                        Nouveau</a>
                    and <a href="#">Cubism</a>, respectively.
