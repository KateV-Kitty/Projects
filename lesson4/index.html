                    exhaust manifold with optimum response characteristics. The V8 engine is also designed for extreme
                    loads on the race track.

                                typical agility of a rear-wheel drive with the control of an all-wheel drive. There is a
                                choice between the drive variants 4WD, 4WD Sport and – in DSC-off mode – 2WD.

                                The Adaptive M suspension comes as a standard and makes it possible to adjust the damper
                                characteristics to suit any given driving situation, increasing driving dynamics and
                                comfort. In addition to the standard COMFORT setting for increased driving comfort, the
                                SPORT program offers more direct damper settings, and SPORT+ for use on the racetrack.

                                is non-corrosive and tolerates even more heat. It impresses with extremely minimal wear
                                and contributes to a lower vehicle weight, which has a positive impact on agility,
                                dynamics and acceleration. The special technical equipment is visible through calipers
                                in the colour Gold matt with M logo on the outside.

                Official data on power consumption and electric range were determined in accordance with the mandatory

                case of a range, figures in the NEDC take into account differences in the selected wheel and tire size;
                figures in the WLTP take into account any optional equipment. WLTP values are used for assessing taxes
                and other vehicle-related charges that are (also) based on CO2 emissions, as well as for the purposes of
                vehicle-specific subsidies, if applicable. Where applicable, the NEDC values listed were calculated
                based on the new WLTP measurement procedure and then converted back to the NEDC measurement procedure
                for comparability reasons. For newly type-tested vehicles since 01.01.2021, the official data no longer
                exist according to NEDC, but only according to WLTP. For more information on the WLTP and NEDC
